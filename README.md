# CeX Price Checker üí∑

A Streamlit web application that fetches the latest "We Sell For" prices from CeX (UK) for your products.

## üö® Recent Updates

**Fixed JavaScript Loading Issue**: The original code wasn't working because the CeX website now uses modern JavaScript (Nuxt.js) to load content dynamically. This has been fixed by implementing Selenium with Chrome WebDriver to wait for JavaScript content to load.

## üåü Features

- **Sample CSV Download**: Download a template CSV with example products
- **Batch Processing**: Upload a CSV with multiple products for bulk price checking
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar during processing  
- **Smart Matching**: Uses similarity scoring to find the best product matches
- **Results Statistics**: View success rates and total values
- **Multiple Download Options**: Download complete results or matches only
- **Caching**: Results are cached for 5 minutes to improve performance

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Chrome browser (installed automatically via webdriver-manager)
- Required packages (install with pip):
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit pandas requests beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager
  ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Local Development
1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run price_checker.py
   ```

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. **Push to GitHub** with all the required files:
   - `price_checker.py` (main app)
   - `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
   - `packages.txt` (system dependencies)
   - `.streamlit/config.toml` (Streamlit configuration)

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud** at https://share.streamlit.io/
   - The app will automatically install Chrome/Chromium
   - All dependencies will be handled automatically
   - The app uses smart fallback: system Chrome on cloud, ChromeDriverManager locally

2. **Download the sample CSV template** to see the expected format

3. **Edit the CSV** with your own products:
   - Replace sample products with your own
   - Be specific with product names for better matches
   - Include details like storage size, color, condition

4. **Upload your CSV** and wait for processing

5. **Download results** in your preferred format

## üí° Tips for Better Results

**Good product names:**
- ‚úÖ "PlayStation 5 Console White"  
- ‚úÖ "Apple MacBook Air M2 13-inch 256GB"
- ‚úÖ "Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 256GB"

**Avoid vague names:**
- ‚ùå "PS5" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Laptop" (too generic)

## üîß Technical Details

### How it works:
1. Uses Selenium WebDriver to load CeX search pages
2. Waits for JavaScript content to fully render
3. Extracts product titles and prices using BeautifulSoup
4. Matches products using difflib similarity scoring
5. Returns best matches with ‚â•30% similarity threshold

### Performance optimizations:
- Headless Chrome browser for faster processing
- Disabled images and plugins to speed up page loads  
- Exponential backoff for content loading
- Results caching to avoid repeat requests
- Browser cleanup on completion/error

## üì¶ Deployment Files

For **Streamlit Cloud** deployment, these files are required:

- **`requirements.txt`**: Python package dependencies
  ```
  streamlit>=1.49.0
  pandas>=2.3.0
  requests>=2.32.0
  beautifulsoup4>=4.13.0
  selenium>=4.35.0
  webdriver-manager>=4.0.0
  ```

- **`packages.txt`**: System-level dependencies
  ```
  chromium-browser
  chromium-chromedriver
  ```

- **`.streamlit/config.toml`**: Streamlit configuration for performance

## üìä Output Format

The results CSV includes:
- **Product Name**: Your original search term
- **CeX Matched Product**: Best matching product found
- **CeX Sell Price (GBP)**: Current selling price 
- **CeX URL**: Direct link to the product page
- **Scraped At (UTC)**: Timestamp of when data was fetched

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **No matches found**: Try more specific product names
- **Slow processing**: Each product takes 3-5 seconds due to JavaScript loading
- **Browser errors**: Chrome will be installed automatically via webdriver-manager

## üìÑ Sample Products Included

The template includes these sample products:
- iPhone 14 128GB
- PlayStation 5 Console  
- Nintendo Switch OLED
